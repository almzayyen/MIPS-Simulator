# MIPS-Simulator
A MIPS Assembly Simulator. Parses and compiles MIPS assembly and uses a virtual machine to simulate commands. 

Written in C++, and tested using Catch2




#Tests
  Includes Unit tests, and integration tests. 
  
 
This can act as a good example for a compiler in C++, because it implements the tokenization, lexing, parsing, and uses an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to implement the MIPS language. It is a fun project if you want to test yourself.
